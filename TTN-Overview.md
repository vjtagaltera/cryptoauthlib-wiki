# LoRa® Security Solution with ATECC608A Secure Element
## Secure Key Provisioning with Microchip and The Things Industries Join Service

CryptoAuthentication™ device (ATECC608A family) and managed LoRa joint servers by The Things Industries enable developers to deploy secure connected applications on LoRaWAN™ networks

As the LoRa® (Long Range) technology ecosystem accelerates, security remains an area for improvement in the market due to vulnerabilities that leave the network and application server keys accessible in the memory of modules and microcontrollers (MCUs) paired with a LoRaWAN™ stack. If keys are accessed in a LoRaWAN device, a hacker can impersonate it and authorize fraudulent transactions, which can result in a scalable attack with substantial losses in service revenue, recovery costs and brand equity. Microchip Technology Inc. (Nasdaq: MCHP), in partnership with The Things Industries, released industry’s first end-to-end security solution that adds secure, trusted and managed authentication to LoRaWAN devices at a global scale. The solution brings hardware-based security to the LoRa ecosystem, combining the MCU- and radio-agnostic ATECC608A-MAHTN-T CryptoAuthentication™ device with The Things Industries’ managed joint servers and Microchip’s secure provisioning service.

The joint solution significantly simplifies provisioning LoRaWAN devices and addresses the inherent logistical challenges that come with managing LoRaWAN authentication keys from inception and throughout the life of a device. Traditionally, network server and application server keys are unprotected in the edge node and unmonitored as LoRaWAN devices pass through various supply chain steps and are then installed in the field. The Common Criteria Joint Interpretation Library (JIL) “high” rated ATECC608A comes pre-configured with secure key storage, keeping a device’s LoRaWAN secret keys isolated from the system so that sensitive keys are never exposed throughout the supply chain nor when the device is deployed. Microchip’s secure manufacturing facilities safely provision keys, eliminating the risk of exposure during manufacturing. Combined with The Things Industries’ agnostic secure joint server service to the LoRaWAN network and application server providers, the solution decreases the risk of device identity corruption by establishing a trusted authentication when a device connects to a network.

Similar to how a pre-paid data plan works for a mobile device, each purchase of an ATECC608A-MAHTN-T device comes with one year of managed LoRaWAN joint server service through The Things Industries. Once a device identifies itself to join a LoRaWAN network, the network contacts The Things Industries joint server to verify that the identity comes from a trusted device and not a fraudulent one. The temporary session keys are then sent securely to the network server and application server of choice. 

>The Things Industries’ joint server along with MCHP pre-provisioned ATECC608A secure element supports any LoRaWAN network, from commercial-operated networks to private networks built on open-source components. 

After the one-year period, The Things Industries provides the option to extend the service. Microchip and The Things Industries have also partnered to make the onboarding process of LoRaWAN devices seamless and secure. 

>LoRaWAN device identities are claimed by The Things Industries’ joint server with minimal intervention, alleviating developers from needing expertise in security. Customers can not only choose any LoRaWAN network but can also migrate to any other LoRaWAN joint server by rekeying the device. This means no vendor lock-in and full control over where and how the device keys are stored.


### Development Tools
The ATECC608A is agnostic and can be paired with any MCU and LoRa radio. 

Developers can deploy secure LoRaWAN devices by combining the ATECC608A with SAMR34 System-in-Package with Microchip’s LoRaWAN stack. Alternatively customers can use SAML21 or any other MCU that is supported by ARM Mbed LoRaWAN stack.

### Pricing and Availability
The ATECC608A-MAHTN-T device for The Things Industries including the initial year of prepaid TTN service is available in volume production for $0.81 each in 10,000 unit quantities.
