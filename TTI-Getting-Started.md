## Purchasing the pre-provisioned ATECC608A-TNGLORA Secure Element

The ATECC608A-TNGLORA Secure Element for use with The Things Industries Join Service can be purchased through Microchip Direct.  Microchip takes care of all the headache behind securely provisioning unique keys into each secure element - all you have to do is purchase the part, install it in your LoRaWAN end-device, and allow it to connect to The Things Industries Join server.

## Claim pre-provisioned Secure Elements into your TTI account

Once your ATECC608A-TNGLORA Secure Elements ship from Microchip Direct, you will be provided with a link to download a Device Manifest file representing your specific pre-provisioned Secure Element chips.

<img src="ttn/images/downloadjson.png" />

Next, you will upload this Device Manifest file into your The Thing Industries account console.  This will claim your batch of ATECC608A-TNGLORA Secure Elements within The Things Industries Join server and automatically associate the secret *AppKey* and *NwkKey* keys with your account.

This is how the claiming process goes...

<img src="ttn/images/warning.png" width=50 align="bottom">**\*Note that your Device Manifest file will not be ready for download immediately after purchase.  Instead, the file will be available once your ATECC608A-TNGLORA Secure Element devices ship.**

After you successfully claim your devices, you can check the available devices in your TTI account under registered devices list.  This ensures that your devices is properly registered and ready to talk to the cloud.

## Hardware Development Tools

### LoRaWAN Gateway
You will need a supported LoRaWAN gateway to get packets from your LoRaWAN end-point to The Things Industries platform.  There are many [commercially available gateways](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/start/list.html), or you can [build your own with a Raspberry Pi](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/start/build.html) and some additional hardware.  **This guide will use [The Things Gateway](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/gateway/)**.

<img src="ttn/images/gateway.png" />

#### Gateway Initialization and Registration

The Things Industries provides a very smooth process to activate your Gateway.  [Activate your Gateway here](https://activate.thethingsnetwork.org/)

Once the Gateway is activated, you can manage the rest of the settings through [The Things Network Console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/).



### Secure Element - ATECC608A-TNGLORA

Your LoRaWAN end-point needs an identity, and the security of that identity is paramount!  Fortunately, the ATECC608A-TNGLORA pre-provisioned part contains all the information necessary to allow your LoRaWAN end-point to securely connect with The Things Industries Join Service.  You can think of the chip like a SIM card for a mobile phone.  For development, and this guide, you will use an AT88CKSCKTUDFN-XPRO socket board to let the SAMR34 XPlained Pro board connect to The Things Industries LoRaWAN Join server.  Here is how to set up the hardware.

#### The ATECC88CKSCKTUDFN-XPro Board

This board connects the ATECC608A-TNGLORA part to the SAMR34 XPlained Pro board.  It is great for prototyping your LoRaWAN application because it gives you the ability to swap out the ATECC608A device so your prototype can take on different identities.  You can also probe the I<sup>2</sup>C lines with a logic analyzer to debug possible problems.

The board needs to be configured for I<sup>2</sup>C communication.  Do this by setting the DIP switches to these settings:

DIP Switch Number

* 1: <font color=Red>**---On---**</font>
* 2: **Off**
* 3: <font color=Red>**---On---**</font>
* 4: **Off**
* 5: **Off**
* 6: <font color=Red>**---On---**</font>
* 7: **Off**
* 8: **Off**

Next, you should make sure that the ATECC608A-TNGLORA has been properly seated in the AT88CKSCKTUDFN-XPro Board's UDFN ZIF socket.  With the AT88CKSCKTUDFN-XPro board horizontal, with the XPro Header facing the left, the Pin 1 location will be located on the bottom-left of the clamshell socket.  It is indicated by a tiny triangle just to the right of the Jumper (JPP1).

<img src="ttn/images/warning.png" width=50 align="bottom">**Note: Make sure that the Secure Element is properly seated in the socket BEFORE you close the clam shell lid.  The chip should be resting evenly in the center of the socket.  It should not be tilted or mis-alligned.  Closing the clam shell lid of the UDFN ZIF socket with the chip mis-alligned will cause the chip to get stuck in the socket and will become difficult to remove.**

#### The SAMR34 XPlained Pro Evaluation Kit

The [SAMR34 Xplained Pro \(PN: dm320111\)](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/dm320111) is a hardware platform designed to evaluate the SAMR34 family of LoRa®  devices.

This FCC, ISED and RED certified board is not only an evaluation platform but also an excellent reference design for developing SAMR34 based LoRa end-node applications.

This kit is supported by the Atmel Studio, an integrated development platform, which provides predefined application examples. The kit also provides easy access to various features of the ATSAMR34J18B device and offers additional peripherals to extend the features of the board and ease the development of custom designs.

Once you have correctly seated the ATECC608A-TNGLORA part in the AT88CKSCKTUDFN-XPro socket, attach the board to the SAMR34 board, on the EXT3 header.  Next, attach a USB cable to SAMR34 XPlained Pro board's EDBG micro-B port on the right.

Here's how your board should look...

#### Other Kits

Other hardware kits can be used with the ATECC608A-TNGLORA Secure Element to connect with TTI's Join server.  ARM's MBED OS is used on MBED enabled platforms, such as the ATSAML21 XPlained Pro board, paired with a SX1276 LoRa radio board.</font>

[ATSAML21-XPRO-B](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/SAML21-XPRO/)

* SX1276 LoRa radio must be connected to **EXT1** (manually wired)
* AT88CKSCKTUDFN-XPro board + ATECC608A-TNGLORA must be connected to **EXT3**


## Software packages and code example

The secure element end-to-end security is supported by more than just Microchip's LoRaWAN stack.  So far, support for the ATECC608A-TNGLORA Secure Element has been added to a custom stack for the SAMR34 series of SiP devices, and for MBED enabled devices like the SAML21 that can run MBED OS.

Notice that the raw bytes of the Payload and DevAddr of the message match what is shown in UART console.

### MBED OS LoRaWAN Stack
Support for the ATECC608A-TNGLORA Secure Element in the MBED OS LoRaWAN stack has been developed and brought to the MBED enabled ATSAML21-XPro-B board.  The source for this project can be [cloned from this branch of MBED OS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-lorawan/tree/ATECC608_PoC).

The MBED OS implementation of the LoRaWAN stack for the SAMR34 is not currently supported, but an implementation should be made available shortly.

## Next steps - Prototype to production transition

Once you have your prototype working just the way you want, the next step is to transition to production.  Moving to production is as simple as ordering the required number of parts - there are no extra steps needed in provisioning large scale numbers of devices.  There are no changes in the Secure Element claiming process.
